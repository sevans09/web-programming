<!-- 
Your assignment is to create a JSON to represent a set list for a cover band.  Each entry should have space to describe the artist(s), title, music genre(s), and year the song was released.

Note:  your object should allow for multiple artists and multiple genre's 

You must include at least 10 songs.  The data must be real.  You may reuse what you had from the XML assignment or add new ones.  You must have songs from at least 3 genres (genre could be country, rock, pop, metal, ska, etc)
