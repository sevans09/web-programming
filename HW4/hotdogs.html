Your assignment is to create a web page to accept an order for a new café called “Joe’s Hotdog Stand”. Joe’s only sells three items: hotdogs ($3.25 each), French Fries ($2.00 each) and Drinks ($1.50 each).  Because of the low prices, Joe is swamped and is hoping online orders will help to manage the flow of customers better so that he can gain more revenue at peak hours.

Create an associative array (or array of objects) to store all items and prices, and another to store items and quantities.

Create a page with a form to get information from the user about the order – specifically the quantity of hotdogs, fries and drinks.  Use the array and a loop to create the part of the form that solicits info about each 

Include a button labeled “Order”.  When the user clicks the button, read all of the information and calculate the order totals.

Add 6.25% Massachusetts meals tax to all orders

Additionally, you will need to implement Joe’s special - 10% discount if the order (before tax) is at least $20

Display all order information in an alert or on the page including:

Items ordered, quantities, subtotal, discount if applicable, tax and total.
